    description: "I implemented the region growing algorithm, being a part of the Shape detection package. The algorithm has been generalized to be working with any user-defined elements, connectivity method, and validity checking rules. Popular instantiations of the algorithm include:<br> <ul><li>Detect 3D planes from a cloud of points with normals attached to them.</li><li>Detect 3D planes in a polygonal mesh.</li><li>Detect 2D lines among a set of 2D points.</li></ul>It searches for spatially neighboring points using Kd tree, and the planes/lines are fit using Linear regression method. It is a robust, simple, and consistent shape detection algorithm, improved from RANSAC method, and is used widely in 3D/2D segmentation."
